Controls how bubble pitches relate to musical scales.

## Scale Selection

| Control | What It Does |
|---------|--------------|
| **Scale** | Choose from 75+ scales including Western modes, world scales, microtonal systems, and experimental tunings. The dropdown shows intervals (e.g., "Major: 2-4-5-7-9-11"). |
| **Root** | The root note of the selected scale (C through B). |

## Pitch Behavior

| Knob | What It Does |
|------|--------------|
| **Gravity** | How strongly bubble pitches snap to scale notes. At 0%, pitches are free and continuous. At 100%, all pitches quantize to the nearest scale degree. |
| **Snap** | Blends between pure physics-based pitch ("Scalar") and FOAM's psychoacoustic processing ("MAGIC"). The MAGIC side adds phantom fundamentals, harmonic enhancement, and perceptual pitch strengthening. |
