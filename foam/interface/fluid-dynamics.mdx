These controls define the liquid that your bubbles exist within. Different liquids produce dramatically different sounds.

## Material Presets

The **Material** dropdown provides scientifically-accurate presets:

| Material | Character |
|----------|-----------|
| **Water** | Bright, crisp pops |
| **Seawater** | Slightly denser, the default starting point |
| **Soap Solution** | Longer-lasting bubbles, softer pops |
| **Glycerol** | Thick, gloopy, slow decay |
| **Honey** | Very viscous, muted and heavy |
| **Mercury** | Extreme density, unusual resonance |

## Manual Controls

When Material is set to "Custom," you have direct control:

| Knob | What It Does |
|------|--------------|
| **Liquid Mass** | Density of the liquid. Higher density = slightly lower pitch and different damping character. |
| **Tension** | Surface tension affects how bubbles form and burst. Low tension = fragile, quick pops. High tension = more crystalline ring. |
| **Viscosity** | How "thick" the liquid is. Low viscosity (like water) gives quick, bright decay. High viscosity (like honey) gives slow, muffled decay. |
