This is the heart of FOAM's sound generation. These controls determine the fundamental character of your bubble sounds.

## Primary Emission

| Knob | What It Does |
|------|--------------|
| **Rate** | How many bubbles are emitted per second. At minimum, you get sparse individual pops. At maximum, a dense foam cascade. Exponentially scaled — small movements at the low end create subtle changes, while the upper range gets dense quickly. |
| **Size** | The physical size of bubbles, which directly determines pitch. Larger bubbles = lower pitch, smaller bubbles = higher pitch. |
| **Ring** | How long each bubble resonates after bursting. Short times (20-50ms) give crisp pops; longer times (up to 500ms) create sustained, bell-like tones. Default is 100ms (physically realistic). |

## Cascade & Movement

| Knob | What It Does |
|------|--------------|
| **Cascade** | When a bubble bursts, it can spawn child bubbles. At 0, bubbles are independent. Higher values create chain reactions — foam avalanches where one pop triggers many. |
| **Glide** | Portamento between bubble sizes. At 0, each bubble has its exact size. Higher values smooth the transition, as if bubbles are expanding or contracting as they rise through liquid. |

## Realism Physics

| Knob | What It Does |
|------|--------------|
| **Shimmer** | Real bubbles aren't perfect spheres — they wobble and deform. This adds subtle pitch modulation, creating organic "chorus-like" movement. |
| **Balance** | Controls the natural amplitude relationship between bubble sizes. At 100% (physics-accurate), large bubbles are louder than small ones. At 0%, all bubbles have equal loudness regardless of size. |
| **Jets** | When bubbles burst at the surface, they can produce secondary "plink" sounds. Adds the characteristic rain-drop-on-water quality. |

## Flow Type

Controls the statistical pattern of bubble emission:

| Mode | Character |
|------|-----------|
| **Poisson** | Random, natural timing — like champagne fizz |
| **Nucleation** | Bubbles emerge in clusters from nucleation sites |
| **Foam Raft** | Dense, raft-like emission patterns |
| **Turbulent** | Chaotic, swirling emission timing |
