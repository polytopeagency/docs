FOAM's interface is organized into five main cards:

| Card | Location | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| **Bubble Physics** | Top Left | How bubbles emerge, pop, ring, and fade |
| **Fluid Dynamics** | Bottom Left | The liquid medium — density, tension, damping |
| **Enhancers** | Top Right | Spatial effects, modulation, and temporal dynamics |
| **Pitch Gravity Logic** | Bottom Right | Scale quantization and pitch behavior |
| **Foam Voicing Dynamics** | Center Bottom | Voice scaling and parallel compression |

## Header Bar

The top bar contains:

- **Preset dropdown** — browse and save presets
- **MIDI Learn** button — click, then right-click any knob to assign a MIDI CC
- **CPU Cut** button — reduces density for low-power machines
- **OSC Setup** button — configure OSC output (green when active)

## Parameter Locking

Right-click any knob to **lock** it. Locked parameters are excluded from:
- Chaos randomization on note-on
- Drift modulation
- Preset changes (locked knobs retain their current value)
