This card handles how multiple simultaneous bubbles are mixed and balanced.

## Intelligent Voice Scaling

These controls manage gain when many bubbles play simultaneously. The system considers multiple factors including frequency content, spatial position, transient preservation, spectral density, cascade depth, and voice age.

| Knob | Range | What It Does |
|------|-------|--------------|
| **Gain Scaling** | Linear - Adapt | Blends between simple 1/sqrt(N) scaling and intelligent multi-factor analysis that considers frequency, spatial position, and transient content. |
| **Freq Summing** | Flat - Physics | How much frequency content affects gain scaling. "Flat" ignores frequency, "Physics" accounts for how similar frequencies sum coherently. |
| **Spatial** | Flat - Wide | How much stereo position affects scaling. "Flat" ignores position, "Wide" reduces gain when bubbles occupy similar positions. |
| **Transients** | Soft - Punch | Preserves attack transients during gain reduction. "Soft" scales everything equally, "Punch" protects the initial pop (first 50ms). |

## Parallel Compression

8-band parallel compression adds density and sustain:

| Control | What It Does |
|---------|--------------|
| **Drive** | Input gain to the compressor (-12 to +12 dB). Boost to drive compression harder. |
| **Band Knobs (63Hz - 8kHz)** | Mix amount of compressed signal per frequency band. At 0% (shows null symbol), that band has no parallel compression. Higher values blend in more compressed signal for that frequency range. |

<Tip>
The band knobs default to 0% (off). This gives you clean, uncompressed sound. Add parallel compression intentionally — try boosting the low bands (63-250Hz) for weight, or the high bands (4k-8k) for presence and sizzle.
</Tip>

All Drive and band knob values are saved with presets and are fully automatable in your DAW.
