title: "What is FOAM?"
description: "Physically-modeled bubble acoustics synthesizer by NOMN"
---

FOAM is a physically-modeled synthesizer that generates sound based on the acoustics of bursting bubbles. Unlike sample-based bubble sounds or generic noise synthesis, FOAM simulates real physics — how bubbles form, resonate, and burst in liquid.

This grounding in actual acoustics produces sounds that are inherently organic and responsive to physical parameters. From single delicate pops to dense cascading foam textures, FOAM brings the sonic world of water and bubbles to your music production.

## Key Features

- **Physics-driven synthesis** — every sound is generated from physical models, not samples
- **99 factory presets** across 8 categories with tier-based organization
- **MIDI playable** — note pitch controls bubble frequency, velocity controls intensity
- **75+ musical scales** with gravity-based pitch quantization
- **8-band parallel compression** for density and sustain control
- **Intelligent voice scaling** — multi-factor gain management for clean mixes at any density
- **OSC output** — stream bubble events to external apps for visualization or processing
- **CPU Cut mode** — optimized playback for low-power machines

## Formats

FOAM is available as:
- **VST3** plugin
- **AU** (Audio Units) plugin
- **Standalone** application

## System Requirements

- macOS 10.15 (Catalina) or later
- Any major DAW: Ableton Live, Logic Pro, FL Studio, Reaper, Pro Tools, Bitwig, Cubase
