## MIDI Input

FOAM responds to MIDI notes:

- **Note pitch** determines the center frequency of bubble emission
- **Velocity** affects emission intensity and initial amplitude
- **Sustain pedal** holds bubble emission while pressed

## Computer Keyboard

When the plugin window is focused, your computer keyboard becomes a playable instrument:

| Row | Notes |
|-----|-------|
| Number row (1-0) | Bass octave (C1-E2) |
| QWERTY row | Low octave (C2-E3) |
| ASDF row | Mid octave (C3-D4) |
| ZXCV row | High octave (C4-B4) |

## MIDI Learn

Assign any MIDI CC to any FOAM parameter:

1. Click the **Learn** button in the header bar
2. Right-click the knob you want to control
3. Move the MIDI CC on your controller

MIDI mappings are saved with your DAW session.
