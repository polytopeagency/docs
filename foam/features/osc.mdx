FOAM can send real-time bubble event data via OSC (Open Sound Control) for visualization, external processing, or creative applications.

## Setup

Click the **OSC Setup** button in the header bar (turns green when active). Configure the destination IP address and port.

## Per-Bubble Events

Each bubble trigger sends:

| Address | Data |
|---------|------|
| `/foam/bubble/trigger` | id, x, y, z, radius, frequency, velocity |

## Aggregate Statistics (60Hz)

FOAM continuously streams summary data:

| Address | Data |
|---------|------|
| `/foam/density` | Current bubble density |
| `/foam/activity` | Voice activity level |
| `/foam/centroid` | Center of mass position |
| `/foam/pitch/average` | Average pitch across active bubbles |
| `/foam/pitch/range` | Pitch range (low to high) |
| `/foam/count` | Active bubble count |

## Configuration

In the OSC settings panel you can toggle individual streams:

- **Position data** — per-bubble spatial coordinates
- **Pitch data** — per-bubble frequency information
- **Aggregate data** — summary statistics

OSC settings are saved with your DAW session.
