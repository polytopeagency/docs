The **CPU Cut** button in the header bar reduces FOAM's processing load by scaling density and bubble size by 0.75x, resulting in fewer simultaneous bubbles.

## When to Use

- Running on a laptop or low-spec machine
- Using multiple instances of FOAM in a session
- Experiencing audio dropouts or glitches

## How It Works

CPU Cut reduces the bubble count without changing the fundamental character of your sound. The tonal quality and spatial properties remain the same — you just get fewer simultaneous bubbles.

## Other CPU Tips

- Reduce **Rate** — fewer bubbles per second means less CPU
- Reduce **Topology** — foam physics simulation is CPU-intensive
- Lower **Cascade** — chain reactions multiply bubble count exponentially
