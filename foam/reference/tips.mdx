## Getting Started

1. **Start simple** — begin with default settings and explore one card at a time
2. **Use material presets** — the Material dropdown is the fastest way to dramatically change character
3. **Rate + Size = Foundation** — these two knobs define 80% of your sound
4. **Add motion last** — get your base sound right before adding Chaos, Drift, or Surge

## Common Gotchas

<Warning>
**Topology CPU Usage** — High Topology values can be CPU-intensive, especially with high Rate. If you experience audio dropouts, reduce Topology or Rate, or enable CPU Cut.
</Warning>

<Warning>
**Surge Needs Headroom** — Surge modulates parameters including Rate. Set Rate to 30-50% to give Surge room to create dynamic swells.
</Warning>

<Warning>
**Cascade Chain Reactions** — High Cascade values with high Rate can create exponential bubble growth. If things get out of control, reduce one or both.
</Warning>

<Info>
**Balance Affects Mix** — At 100% Balance (physics-accurate), large/low bubbles dominate the mix. If you want more high-frequency content to cut through, reduce Balance.

## Sound Design Tips

### Sparse, Delicate Pops
- Rate: low (5-15%)
- Size: medium
- Ring: short (20-50ms)
- Flow Type: Poisson
- Material: Water

### Dense Foam Cascade
- Rate: high (70-100%)
- Cascade: medium-high
- Material: Soap Solution
- Surge: Gush or Roil
- Add Drift for evolving texture

### Musical / Tonal
- Set Gravity to 80-100%
- Choose a scale and root note
- Snap towards MAGIC for stronger pitch perception
- Use Scatter for natural variation between voices

### Deep Sub Bass
- Size: large
- Rate: low-medium
- Compress low bands (63-250Hz) in Voicing Dynamics
- Balance: reduce to let low frequencies through evenly
