FOAM implements real acoustic physics — not approximations or samples. Every sound is generated from physical models of how bubbles actually behave in liquid.

## What Makes FOAM Different

Most synthesizers that produce "bubble" or "water" sounds use either samples or basic noise shaping. FOAM takes a fundamentally different approach: it simulates the actual physics of gas bubbles in liquid — how they form, resonate, interact, and burst.

This means:
- **Bubble pitch is physically accurate** — determined by size, liquid properties, and pressure
- **Decay and damping respond to the medium** — water sounds different from honey because the physics are different
- **Collective behavior emerges naturally** — dense bubble populations interact and influence each other
- **Surface effects are modeled** — reflections, secondary emissions, and interference patterns arise from the physics

## Core Acoustics

FOAM models the complete lifecycle of a bubble burst event:

1. **Film rupture** — the thin cap breaks, producing a broadband transient
2. **Cavity resonance** — the open cavity rings at a pitch determined by bubble size and liquid properties
3. **Damping** — the oscillation decays through multiple physical mechanisms that depend on bubble size and liquid viscosity

## Population Effects

When many bubbles are present simultaneously, FOAM models their collective behavior:

- Dense bubble clouds affect each other's resonant behavior
- Statistical size distributions create natural spectral profiles
- Spatial proximity between bubbles creates organic pitch and amplitude variation

## Foam Structure

The Topology system models how structured foam evolves over time:

- Foam coarsens as bubbles grow and shrink
- Structural rearrangements produce characteristic acoustic events
- Phase transitions create dramatic textural shifts
- Stressed foam exhibits yield and avalanche behavior

## Surface & Secondary Effects

FOAM also models phenomena that occur at and above the liquid surface:

- Surface reflections create interference and depth cues
- Cavity collapse can produce secondary acoustic events
- Depth and pressure affect pitch
- Non-spherical deformation adds organic modulation

## Physical Accuracy

FOAM's material presets (Water, Seawater, Soap Solution, Glycerol, Honey, Mercury) use measured physical properties of real liquids. When you adjust Liquid Mass, Tension, and Viscosity manually, you're directly controlling the physical parameters of the simulation.
