FOAM implements peer-reviewed acoustic physics — not approximations or samples.

## Core Bubble Acoustics

| Model | What It Does | Source |
|-------|--------------|--------|
| **Minnaert resonance** | Bubble radius determines pitch (f proportional to 1/R) with surface tension correction | Leighton eq. 3.122 |
| **Prosperetti thermal damping** | Small bubbles decay adiabatically, large bubbles isothermally, with smooth transition | Prosperetti (1977) |
| **Three damping mechanisms** | Thermal + viscous + radiation damping combined | Leighton eq. 4.30 |
| **Two-phase burst model** | Film rupture (broadband crack) then cavity resonance (chirping tone) | Leighton Section 3.8 |

## Population & Collective Effects

| Model | What It Does | Source |
|-------|--------------|--------|
| **Void fraction coupling** | Dense bubble clouds shift each other's resonant frequencies | Leighton eq. 4.23 |
| **Wood's equation** | Sound speed in gas-liquid mixtures (the "hot chocolate effect") | Wood (1941) |
| **Spatial coupling** | Nearby bubbles modulate each other's pitch and amplitude | Leighton Ch. 4 |
| **Deane-Stokes distribution** | Power-law bubble size statistics from wave-breaking research | Deane & Stokes (2002) |

## Foam Topology

| Model | What It Does | Source |
|-------|--------------|--------|
| **Von Neumann dynamics** | Foam coarsening law: dA/dt = K(n-6) drives pitch evolution | Von Neumann |
| **T1 events** | Neighbor-switching when films snap through (Plateau's 120-degree law) with Minnaert-based frequencies | Weaire & Hutzler |
| **T2 events** | Bubble collapse with accelerating chirp as radius approaches zero | Topology physics |
| **Jamming transition** | Phase change at critical packing fraction | Liu & Nagel |
| **Herschel-Bulkley rheology** | Yield stress and avalanche dynamics in stressed foam | Rheology literature |

## Surface & Secondary Effects

| Model | What It Does | Source |
|-------|--------------|--------|
| **Lloyd's Mirror** | Surface reflection creates comb-filtering interference | Acoustic imaging |
| **Worthington jets** | Cavity collapse creates upward jet producing secondary "plink" droplets | Pumphrey & Crum |
| **Hydrostatic pressure** | Depth affects bubble pitch | Basic physics |
| **Initial compression** | Bubbles born compressed from pinch-off, releasing stored energy | Pumphrey & Crum |
| **Shape mode oscillation** | Non-spherical wobble adds organic "shimmer" modulation | Prosperetti |
