## 1. Load FOAM

Open FOAM as a standalone app, or load it as a plugin in your DAW.

## 2. Play Some Notes

FOAM responds to MIDI input. If you don't have a MIDI controller, use the computer keyboard:

| Row | Notes |
|-----|-------|
| Number row (1-0) | Bass octave (C1-E2) |
| QWERTY row | Low octave (C2-E3) |
| ASDF row | Mid octave (C3-D4) |
| ZXCV row | High octave (C4-B4) |

## 3. Explore Presets

Use the **Preset** dropdown in the header to browse 99 factory presets organized by category:

- **Bass & Sub** — deep, low-end focused
- **Cinematic** — atmospheric, evolving textures
- **Extreme** — aggressive, dense cascades
- **Musical** — melodic, tonal bubbles
- **Nature** — organic, realistic water sounds
- **Percussion** — rhythmic, transient-focused
- **Texture** — ambient, layered soundscapes
- **Tonal** — pitched, harmonic content

Presets are tagged by playing style: Single, Triad, Layer, Cluster, Sequence.

## 4. Shape Your Sound

The two most important controls:

- **Rate** (Bubble Physics card) — sparse pops to dense foam cascades
- **Size** (Bubble Physics card) — large/low bubbles to tiny/high pops

These two knobs define 80% of your sound character.

## 5. Change the Medium

Try different **Material** presets in the Fluid Dynamics card — Water, Soap Solution, Honey, Mercury. Each produces dramatically different tones.

## 6. Add Motion

Once you have a base sound you like:

- **Drift** — slow, evolving parameter changes over 30-120 seconds
- **Scatter** — per-bubble random variation for natural ensemble feel
- **Surge** — physics-based envelopes that trigger on each note

## Next Steps

Explore each card in detail:

- [Bubble Physics](/interface/bubble-physics) — emission, size, resonance
- [Fluid Dynamics](/interface/fluid-dynamics) — liquid materials and properties
- [Enhancers](/interface/enhancers) — spatial, modulation, surge
- [Pitch Gravity](/interface/pitch-gravity) — scales and pitch behavior
- [Voicing Dynamics](/interface/voicing-dynamics) — mixing, compression
